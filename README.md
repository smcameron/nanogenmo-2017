Nanogenmo 2017 -- November is National Novel (procedural) Generation Month

Here it is December 1, 2017, and so it's time to upload a "novel", or at
least the very long and boring account of some restless, dumb, drunk, depressed
and bored automatons moving aimlessly, without reason or motivation, about their
sad, cookie-cutter planets via various ridiculous conveyances.

So, here's some output:
